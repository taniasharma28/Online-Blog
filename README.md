## BASIC CONCEPT OF SOFTWARE TESTING
What is Software Testing?
Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.

Why Software Testing is Important?
Software Testing is Important because if there are any bugs or errors in the software, it can be identified early and can be solved before delivery of the software product. Properly tested software product ensures reliability, security and high performance which further results in time saving, cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

What are the benefits of Software Testing?
Here are the benefits of using software testing: Cost-Effective: It is one of the important advantages of software testing. Testing any IT project on time helps you to save your money for the long term. In case if the bugs caught in the earlier stage of software testing, it costs less to fix. Security: It is the most vulnerable and sensitive benefit of software testing. People are looking for trusted products. It helps in removing risks and problems earlier. Product quality: It is an essential requirement of any software product. Testing ensures a quality product is delivered to customers. Customer Satisfaction: The main aim of any product is to give satisfaction to their customers. UI/UX Testing ensures the best user experience.

Types of Testing
1. FUNCTIONAL TESTING:
Functional testing checks an application, website, or system to ensure it’s doing exactly what it’s supposed to be doing.

2. NON FUNCTIONAL TESTING:
Non functional testing verifies the readiness of a system according to nonfunctional parameters (performance, accessibility, UX, etc.) which are never addressed by functional testing.

3. WHITE BOX:
White box testing involves testing the product's underlying structure, architecture, and code to validate input-output flow and enhance design, usability, and security.

4. BLACK BOX:
Black box testing involves testing against a system where the code and paths are invisible.

5. SMOKE TESTING:
This type of software testing validates the stability of a software application, it is performed on the initial software build to ensure that the critical functions of the program are working.

6. RETESTING TESTING:
Testing after debugging to ensure defects are fixed.

7. STATIC TESTING:
In this, we don't execute anything. It includes reviewing the requirement, reviewing the user storage,review the code,revir=ew a prototype of application and give some note about it.

8. DYNAMIC TESTING:
It is used in software engineering to describe the testing of the dynamic behavior of code

### Day 3: 25 febuary 2022 
## TEST PROCESS ACTIVITIES
set of activities that should be followed during software testing to produce quality software or application.

1. Test Planning:
- Determining the scope, objectives, and risks of testing
- Defining the overall approach of testing
- Integrating and coordinating the test activities into the software lifecycle activities
- Making decisions about what to test, the people and other resources required to perform the various test activities, and how test activities will be carried out
- Selecting metrics for test monitoring and control
- Budgeting for the test activities

2. Test Monitoring and Control
- Produce comparison report of actual progress against planned progress
- Test control involves taking actions necessary to meet the objectives of the test plan

3. Test Analysis
- “what to test”
- Analyzing the test basis appropriate to the test level being considered
- Evaluating the test basis and test items to identify defects of various types
- Identifying features and sets of features to be tested

4. Test Design
- “how to test?”
- Designing and prioritizing test cases and sets of test cases
- Identifying necessary test data to support test conditions and test cases
- Designing the test environment and identifying any required infrastructure and tools
- Capturing bi-directional traceability between the test basis, test conditions, and test cases

5. Test Implementation
- “do we now have everything in place to run the tests?”
- Developing and prioritizing test procedures and, potentially creating automated test scripts
- Creating test suites from the test procedures and (if any) automated test scripts
- Arranging the test suites within a test execution schedule in a way that results in efficient test execution
- building the test environment (including, potentially, test harnesses, service virtualization, simulators, and other infrastructure items) and verifying that everything needed has been set up correctly
- Preparing test data and ensuring it is properly loaded in the test environment

6.Test Execution
- Recording the IDs and versions of the test item(s) or test object, test tool(s), and test ware
- Executing tests either manually or by using test execution tools
- Comparing actual results with expected results
- Reporting defects based on the failures observed
- Repeating test activities either as a result of action taken for an anomaly, or as part of the planned testing (e.g., execution of a corrected test, confirmation testing, and/or regression testing)

7. Test Completion
- Checking whether all defect reports are closed, entering change requests or product backlog items for any defects that remain unresolved at the end of test execution
- Creating a test summary report to be communicated to stakeholders
- Finalizing and archiving the test environment, the test data, the test infrastructure, and other test-ware for later reuse
- Handing over the test-ware to the maintenance teams, other project teams, and/or other stakeholders who could benefit from its use
- Analyzing lessons learned from the completed test activities to determine changes needed for future iterations, releases, and projects
- Using the information gathered to improve test process maturity

### Day 4: 25 febuary 2022
## WHAT IS PERFORMANCE TESTING ?
Performance testing is a non-functional software testing technique that determines how the stability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of an application holds up under a given workload. It’s a key step in ensuring software quality.
The goals of performance testing include evaluating application output, processing speed, data transfer velocity, network bandwidth usage, maximum concurrent users, memory utilization, workload efficiency, and command response times.

Reasons for Performance Testing
- To determine whether the application satisfies performance requirements (for instance, the system should handle up to 1,000 concurrent users).
- To locate computing bottlenecks within an application.
- To establish whether the performance levels claimed by a software vendor are indeed true.
- To compare two or more systems and identify the one that performs best.
- To measure stability under peak traffic events.

### Day 5: 28 febuary 2022
## TYPES OF PERFORMANCE TESTING

1. Endurance Testing
Endurance testing evaluates the performance of the system under load over time. It is executed by applying varying loads to the application under test for an extended period of time to validate that the performance requirements related to production loads and durations of those loads are met.

2. Load Testing
The purpose of load testing is to evaluate the application’s performance under increasingly high numbers of users.

3. Spike Testing
This testing evaluates the ability of the application to handle sudden volume increases. It is done by suddenly increasing the load generated by a very large number of users. The goal is to determine whether performance will suffer, the system will fail, or it will be able to handle dramatic changes in load.

4. Volume Testing
Also known as flood testing, this testing is used to evaluate the application’s ability to handle large volumes of data. The impact on response time and the behavior of the application are analyzed. This testing can be used to identify bottlenecks and to determine the capacity of the system.

5. Stress Testing
This test pushes an application beyond normal load conditions to determine which components fail first. Stress testing attempts to find the breaking point of the application

6. Scalability Testing
This testing is used to determine your application’s ability to handle increasing amounts of load and processing. It involves measuring attributes including response time, throughput, hits and requests per second, transaction processing speed, CPU usage, Network usage and more.

## Basics of SQL

what is database?
A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed.You can organize data into tables, rows, columns, and index it to make it easier to find relevant information.

what is SQL?
SQL or Structured Query Language is used to operate on the data stored in a database.

what is RDBMS?
A relational database management system (RDBMS or just RDB) is a common type of database that stores data in tables, so it can be used in relation to other stored datasets.

What is table?
The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. The table is a collection of related data entries
and it consists of columns and rows.

What is field?
Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields.
A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table.

What is record or row?
A record, also called a row of data, is each individual entry that exists in a table.A record is a horizontal entity in a table.

What is column?
A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.

What is NULL value?
A NULL value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank, which means a field with a NULL value is a
field with no value.

### Day8: 4 March 2022
## Basic Commands in SQL

These SQL commands are mainly categorized into four categories as: 

- DDL – Data Definition Language
- DQl – Data Query Language
- DML – Data Manipulation Language
- DCL – Data Control Language

1.List of DDL commands: 

- CREATE: This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).
- DROP: This command is used to delete objects from the database.
- ALTER: This is used to alter the structure of the database.
- TRUNCATE: This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
- COMMENT: This is used to add comments to the data dictionary.
- RENAME: This is used to rename an object existing in the database.

2.List of DQL: 

- SELECT: It is used to retrieve data from the database.

3.List of DML commands: 

- INSERT : It is used to insert data into a table.
- UPDATE: It is used to update existing data within a table.
-DELETE : It is used to delete records from a database table.

4.List of  DCL commands: 

- GRANT: This command gives users access privileges to the database.
- REVOKE: This command withdraws the user’s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.

### Day9: 7 March 2022
## Data Types in sql

- NUMERIC DATA TYPE:
  - int
  - float
  - decimal
- NON-NUMERIC DATA TYPE:
  - char
  - varchar
  - ENUM
  - Boolean
- DATA AND TIME DATA TYPE:
   - TIME: Time(HHH-MM-SS)

### Day10: 8 March 2022
## Keys Concept:
Primary key and foreign key

- Primary key:
It is the first key used to identify one and only one instance of an entity uniquely.
- Foreign key:
Foreign keys are the column of the table used to point to the primary key of another table.
- Super Key:
Super key is an attribute set that can uniquely identify a tuple. A super key is a superset of a candidate key.
-  Candidate key:
A candidate key is an attribute or set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple.
Except for the primary key, the remaining attributes are considered a candidate key. The candidate keys are as strong as the primary key.
-  Alternate key
There may be one or more attributes or a combination of attributes that uniquely identify each tuple in a relation. These attributes or combinations of the attributes are called the candidate keys. One key is chosen as the primary key from these candidate keys, and the remaining candidate key, if it exists, is termed the alternate key.
- Composite key
Whenever a primary key consists of more than one attribute, it is known as a composite key. This key is also known as Concatenated Key.
- Artificial key
The key created using arbitrarily assigned data are known as artificial keys. These keys are created when a primary key is large and complex and has no relationship with many other relations.

### Day11: 9 March 2022
## SQL clauses:
- CONSTRAINT clause:
A CONSTRAINT clause is an optional part of a CREATE TABLE statement or an ALTER TABLE statement. A constraint is a rule to which data must conform. Constraint names are optional.

- FOR UPDATE clause:
The FOR UPDATE clause is an optional part of a SELECT statement.

- FROM clause:
The FROM clause is a mandatory clause in a selectExpression.

- GROUP BY clause:
A GROUP BY clause, part of a selectExpression, groups a result into subsets that have matching values for one or more columns.

- HAVING clause:
A HAVING clause restricts the results of a GROUP BY in a selectExpression.

- ORDER BY clause:
The ORDER BY clause is an optional element of several statements, expressions, and subqueries.

- USING clause:
The USING clause specifies which columns to test for equality when two tables are joined.

- WHERE clause:
A WHERE clause is an optional part of a selectExpression, DELETE statement, or UPDATE statement. The WHERE clause lets you select rows based on a boolean expression.

### Day12: 10 March 2022
## SQL Functions
SQL has many built-in functions for performing processing on string or numeric data. Following is the list of
all useful SQL built-in functions:
1. SQL COUNT Function - The SQL COUNT aggregate function is used to count the number of rows in a
database table.<br>
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <Tablename>;

2. SQL MAX Function - The SQL MAX aggregate function allows us to select the highest (maximum) value for a
certain column.<br>
SELECT MAX(*) FROM <Tablename>;

3. SQL MIN Function - The SQL MIN aggregate function allows us to select the lowest (minimum) value for a
certain column.<br>
SELECT MIN(*) FROM <Tablename>;

4. SQL AVG Function - The SQL AVG aggregate function selects the average value for certain table column.<br>
SELECT AVG(*) FROM <Tablename>;

5. SQL SUM Function - The SQL SUM aggregate function allows selecting the total for a numeric column.<br>
SELECT SUM(*) FROM <Tablename>;

6. SQL SQRT Functions - This is used to generate a square root of a given number.<br>
select SQRT(16);

7. SQL RAND Function - This is used to generate a random number using SQL command.<br>
 SELECT RAND( ), RAND( ), RAND( );

8. SQL CONCAT Function - This is used to concatenate any string inside any SQL command.<br>

### Day13: 11 March 2022
## TABLES
  
- The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.<br>
Syntax:<br>
CREATE TABLE table_name (<br>
    column1 datatype,<br>
    column2 datatype,<br>
    column3 datatype,<br>
   ....<br>
);

- Create Table Using Another Table i.e A copy of an existing table can also be created using CREATE TABLE.<br>
Syntax:<br>
CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS <br>
    SELECT column1, column2,... <br>
    FROM existing_table_name <br>
    WHERE ....;
    
- The DROP TABLE statement is used to drop an existing table in a database.<br>
Syntax:<br>
DROP TABLE table_name;

- The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.<br>
Syntax:<br>
ALTER TABLE table_name<br>
ADD column_name datatype;
  
### Day14: 14 March 2022
## SQL Constraints:
Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on table.<br>
Following are commonly used constraints available in SQL:
1. NOT NULL Constraint: Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.
2. DEFAULT Constraint: Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.
3. UNIQUE Constraint: Ensures that all values in a column are different.
4. PRIMARY Key: Uniquely identified each rows/records in a database table.
5. FOREIGN Key: Uniquely identified a rows/records in any another table.
  
### Day15: 15 March 2022
## SQL SUBQUERY:
In SQL a Subquery can be simply defined as a query within another query. In other words we can say that a Subquery is a query that is embedded in WHERE clause of another SQL query.<br>

Important rules for Subqueries:

- You can place the Subquery in a number of SQL clauses: WHERE clause, HAVING clause, FROM clause.
- Subqueries can be used with SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE statements along with expression operator. It could be equality operator or comparison operator such as =, >, =, <= and Like operator.
- A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is called as main query and inner query is called as subquery.
- The subquery generally executes first, and its output is used to complete the query condition for the main or outer query.
- Subquery must be enclosed in parentheses.
- Subqueries are on the right side of the comparison operator.
- ORDER BY command cannot be used in a Subquery. GROUPBY command can be used to perform same function as ORDER BY command.
- Use single-row operators with singlerow Subqueries. Use multiple-row operators with multiple-row Subqueries.

Syntax:<br>
SELECT column_name<br>
FROM table_name<br>
WHERE column_name expression operator<br> 
    ( SELECT COLUMN_NAME  from TABLE_NAME   WHERE ... );
