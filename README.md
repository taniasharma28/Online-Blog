## BASIC CONCEPT OF SOFTWARE TESTING
What is Software Testing?
Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.

Why Software Testing is Important?
Software Testing is Important because if there are any bugs or errors in the software, it can be identified early and can be solved before delivery of the software product. Properly tested software product ensures reliability, security and high performance which further results in time saving, cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

What are the benefits of Software Testing?
Here are the benefits of using software testing: Cost-Effective: It is one of the important advantages of software testing. Testing any IT project on time helps you to save your money for the long term. In case if the bugs caught in the earlier stage of software testing, it costs less to fix. Security: It is the most vulnerable and sensitive benefit of software testing. People are looking for trusted products. It helps in removing risks and problems earlier. Product quality: It is an essential requirement of any software product. Testing ensures a quality product is delivered to customers. Customer Satisfaction: The main aim of any product is to give satisfaction to their customers. UI/UX Testing ensures the best user experience.

Types of Testing
1. FUNCTIONAL TESTING:
Functional testing checks an application, website, or system to ensure it’s doing exactly what it’s supposed to be doing.

2. NON FUNCTIONAL TESTING:
Non functional testing verifies the readiness of a system according to nonfunctional parameters (performance, accessibility, UX, etc.) which are never addressed by functional testing.

3. WHITE BOX:
White box testing involves testing the product's underlying structure, architecture, and code to validate input-output flow and enhance design, usability, and security.

4. BLACK BOX:
Black box testing involves testing against a system where the code and paths are invisible.

5. SMOKE TESTING:
This type of software testing validates the stability of a software application, it is performed on the initial software build to ensure that the critical functions of the program are working.

6. RETESTING TESTING:
Testing after debugging to ensure defects are fixed.

7. STATIC TESTING:
In this, we don't execute anything. It includes reviewing the requirement, reviewing the user storage,review the code,revir=ew a prototype of application and give some note about it.

8. DYNAMIC TESTING:
It is used in software engineering to describe the testing of the dynamic behavior of code

## TEST PROCESS ACTIVITIES
set of activities that should be followed during software testing to produce quality software or application.

1. Test Planning:
- Determining the scope, objectives, and risks of testing
- Defining the overall approach of testing
- Integrating and coordinating the test activities into the software lifecycle activities
- Making decisions about what to test, the people and other resources required to perform the various test activities, and how test activities will be carried out
- Selecting metrics for test monitoring and control
- Budgeting for the test activities

2. Test Monitoring and Control
- Produce comparison report of actual progress against planned progress
- Test control involves taking actions necessary to meet the objectives of the test plan

3. Test Analysis
- “what to test”
- Analyzing the test basis appropriate to the test level being considered
- Evaluating the test basis and test items to identify defects of various types
- Identifying features and sets of features to be tested

4. Test Design
- “how to test?”
- Designing and prioritizing test cases and sets of test cases
- Identifying necessary test data to support test conditions and test cases
- Designing the test environment and identifying any required infrastructure and tools
- Capturing bi-directional traceability between the test basis, test conditions, and test cases

5. Test Implementation
- “do we now have everything in place to run the tests?”
- Developing and prioritizing test procedures and, potentially creating automated test scripts
- Creating test suites from the test procedures and (if any) automated test scripts
- Arranging the test suites within a test execution schedule in a way that results in efficient test execution
- building the test environment (including, potentially, test harnesses, service virtualization, simulators, and other infrastructure items) and verifying that everything needed has been set up correctly
- Preparing test data and ensuring it is properly loaded in the test environment

6.Test Execution
- Recording the IDs and versions of the test item(s) or test object, test tool(s), and test ware
- Executing tests either manually or by using test execution tools
- Comparing actual results with expected results
- Reporting defects based on the failures observed
- Repeating test activities either as a result of action taken for an anomaly, or as part of the planned testing (e.g., execution of a corrected test, confirmation testing, and/or regression testing)

7. Test Completion
- Checking whether all defect reports are closed, entering change requests or product backlog items for any defects that remain unresolved at the end of test execution
- Creating a test summary report to be communicated to stakeholders
- Finalizing and archiving the test environment, the test data, the test infrastructure, and other test-ware for later reuse
- Handing over the test-ware to the maintenance teams, other project teams, and/or other stakeholders who could benefit from its use
- Analyzing lessons learned from the completed test activities to determine changes needed for future iterations, releases, and projects
- Using the information gathered to improve test process maturity

## WHAT IS PERFORMANCE TESTING ?
Performance testing is a non-functional software testing technique that determines how the stability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of an application holds up under a given workload. It’s a key step in ensuring software quality.
The goals of performance testing include evaluating application output, processing speed, data transfer velocity, network bandwidth usage, maximum concurrent users, memory utilization, workload efficiency, and command response times.

Reasons for Performance Testing
- To determine whether the application satisfies performance requirements (for instance, the system should handle up to 1,000 concurrent users).
- To locate computing bottlenecks within an application.
- To establish whether the performance levels claimed by a software vendor are indeed true.
- To compare two or more systems and identify the one that performs best.
- To measure stability under peak traffic events.

### Day 5: 28 febuary 2022
## TYPES OF PERFORMANCE TESTING

1. Endurance Testing
Endurance testing evaluates the performance of the system under load over time. It is executed by applying varying loads to the application under test for an extended period of time to validate that the performance requirements related to production loads and durations of those loads are met.

2. Load Testing
The purpose of load testing is to evaluate the application’s performance under increasingly high numbers of users.

3. Spike Testing
This testing evaluates the ability of the application to handle sudden volume increases. It is done by suddenly increasing the load generated by a very large number of users. The goal is to determine whether performance will suffer, the system will fail, or it will be able to handle dramatic changes in load.

4. Volume Testing
Also known as flood testing, this testing is used to evaluate the application’s ability to handle large volumes of data. The impact on response time and the behavior of the application are analyzed. This testing can be used to identify bottlenecks and to determine the capacity of the system.

5. Stress Testing
This test pushes an application beyond normal load conditions to determine which components fail first. Stress testing attempts to find the breaking point of the application

6. Scalability Testing
This testing is used to determine your application’s ability to handle increasing amounts of load and processing. It involves measuring attributes including response time, throughput, hits and requests per second, transaction processing speed, CPU usage, Network usage and more.
